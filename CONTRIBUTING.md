Thanks for your interest!

## Development
1. Create a virtualenv and install `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `pytest -q` locally before committing.
3. Use feature branches; submit PRs with a clear description and screenshots for UI changes.

## Coding Style
- Follow PEP8; `flake8` enforces lint rules.
- Small, focused PRs are easier to review.

## Tests
- Add unit tests for new features (see `tests/`).
